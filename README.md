# __Project SH/\RP:__  
![](https://dl.michaelpmiddleton.com/SHRP/showcase.gif "Showcase of SH/\RP")  
SHRP (pronounced "sharp" and stylized as "SH/\RP") is a hyper-casual mobile game where you attempt to pass through never ending barriers following the shapes of the holes in the barrier. The name itself is an acronym of the phrase "square hole, round peg," which was the inspiration of the game.
